# Getting-Cleaning-Bat-Data
This procedure takes training and test data and congeals them into a tidy data set for averaging.

A few important points:

(a) "Features" are the variable names (column names).
(b) Test labels and Training labels are the NUMERIC activity labels.
        Note that these are later converted into sensible language via the activity_labels.

This assumes that you have the dplyr package installed.

The attached CodeBook.md is an additional useful reference to the variable names.
